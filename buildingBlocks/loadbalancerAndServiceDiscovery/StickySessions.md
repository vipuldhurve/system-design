# Sticky Sessions
- In cloud computing, particularly in the context of web applications, "sticky sessions" refer to a mechanism used for load balancing and session management. 
- Load Balancers ensures requests from the same client are directed to the same server for session consistency.
- This ensures continuity in the user's session data, such as shopping cart contents, login status, or any other personalized information.
- Sticky sessions are essential for applications that store session data locally on the server instance, rather than in a shared or distributed storage system.

#### Other benefits:

- <b><i>Minimized data exchange:</b></i> When using sticky sessions, servers within your network don’t need to exchange session data, a costly process when done on scale.
- <b><i>RAM cache utilization:</b></i> Sticky sessions allow for more effective utilization of your application’s RAM cache, resulting in better responsiveness.


## How are Sticky Sessions Implemented?
Implementing sticky sessions involves configuring the load balancer to use a mechanism such as session affinity or cookie-based routing. Here's a brief overview of these methods:

### Session Affinity
- Also known as "IP Hash" or "Source IP Affinity"
- this method uses the client's IP address to determine which server instance should handle their requests. 
- The load balancer hashes the client's IP address and consistently routes their requests to the same server based on the hash value.

### Cookie-based Routing
- In this approach, the load balancer sets a cookie in the user's browser after their initial request. 
- The cookie contains information identifying the server instance handling the session. 
- Subsequent requests from the same user include this cookie, allowing the load balancer to route them to the appropriate server.


## Drawbacks of Sticky Sessions
While sticky sessions provide benefits for certain applications, they also come with some drawbacks:
- <b><i>Increased Server Load:</b></i> Since requests from the same user are directed to a single server, it may experience higher load compared to others, potentially leading to resource contention and reduced scalability.
- <b><i>Session Persistence Issues:</b></i> If the server handling a user's session fails or becomes unavailable, the user may experience service disruption or loss of session data. Implementing session persistence mechanisms, such as session replication or failover, can mitigate this risk but adds complexity to the architecture.

### Summary
- Sticky sessions play a crucial role in maintaining session continuity for web applications that rely on server-side session management. 
- However, they require careful consideration of trade-offs in terms of scalability, reliability, and complexity in the overall system design.
